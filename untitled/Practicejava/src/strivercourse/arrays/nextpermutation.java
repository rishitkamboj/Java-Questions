    // BRUTE FORCE
    /* Generate all the permutations
    (generate in sorted order)
    Then do linear search find the specific given array and then the next index is the answers
    Use recursion for generationnnnn


    Dont solve this just explain it will take (N! *N) time for solving and for a length like 15 it might take
    10^12 time and that is very high so we will just not use this

    Never ever get into Brute force solution just explain the code to
    interviewer and dont go

    // BETTER APPROACH

    /*no better approach for java but for C++ you can use in-built STL library and use next_permutation
  */

    //OPTIMAL APPROACH
    /*

  observation --- algorithm--- dry run--- code
  arr[]={2154300];
